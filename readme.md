As an AI, I'm unable to see the code you're referring to as the question is phrased ambiguously. However, if you want to create a README file to explain how to practice with a `llama.cpp` server for a continuous extension, you can use markdown language. Here is a basic example:

```markdown
# Llama Server Practice

This README provides an overview of how to practice with the `llama.cpp` server for a continuous extension.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to have a basic understanding of C++ and server-side programming. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourGithubUsername/llamaServer.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd llamaServer`
3. Compile the `llama.cpp` file: `g++ -o llama llama.cpp`

## Running the Server

To run the server, use the following command: `./llama`

## Practicing

To practice with the `llama.cpp` server, you can try extending its functionality. For example, you could add additional endpoints, implement different HTTP methods, or integrate it with a database.

Remember, the key to mastering any skill is continuous practice. Keep experimenting with different features and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Happy coding!
